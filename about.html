		<pre class="about-me"> Hey, this i my homepage, so I have to say something about myself. It is hard to introduce yourself because you know
 yourself so well that yo do  not know from where to start.
 Let me give a try to see what kind of impression I can left on you by my self-description. I hope that I can express
 myself so well that your impression about me and mine about me would not differ much.
 Here it goes, I am a person who is positive about every aspect of life. There are many things I like to do, to see,
 and to experience. I like to read, I like to write, I like to think, I like to listen, I like to talk, I like to see
 the sunrise in the morning, i like to see the moonlight at night; I like to feel the music and dance with its beat;
 I like to smell the wind coming from the ocean. I like to look at the cloud in the sky and make my mind blank,
 I like   flower in spring, rain in summer, leaves in autumn, and snow in winter.
 
 I like to sleep early, wake up late; I like to be alone. I like good books and romantic movies. I like the land,
 the nature and the people. And, I like to laugh.
 I always wanted to be a great cricketer, like "Virat Kholi", or like "Virendar Shewag", or like"Saurav Ganguly"
 and also a fielder like "Mohd. Kaif". Of course I am no where close to these people.
 This is a brief introduction of myself.</pre>
